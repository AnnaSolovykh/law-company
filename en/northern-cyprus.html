                    Northern Cyprus was established in 1983, following the Turkish military intervention in 1974 in response to a coup aimed at unifying Cyprus with Greece. This intervention led to the de facto division of Cyprus into two parts, the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus in the south and the self-declared TRNC in the north.
